# 📖 Jules Orchestration Glossary
> The Ubiquitous Language for our God-Tier Jules CLI.

## Core Concepts

### Remote Session
The primary unit of collaboration. It represents an active, remote workspace where Jules (the autonomous agent) is executing a **Task**. 
*   **Official ID:** The unique name assigned by the Jules API (e.g., `sessions/123`).

### Task
A specific mission or goal assigned to Jules (e.g., "Fix the login bug"). It is the "What" of the session.

### Base Branch
The point of origin for the work. Jules clones the repository and branches **OFF** of this branch to begin her task. 
*   *Default:* If not specified, it defaults to the project's primary branch (e.g., `main`).

### Session Branch
The specific branch created by Jules to contain her changes. 
*   **Rule:** One **Remote Session** is strictly tied to exactly **One Session Branch**. 
*   **Naming:** Can be user-specified or auto-generated by Jules.

### Talk
A continuous, interactive conversation loop between the Developer and Jules. Used for providing feedback, asking for status, or refining the **Task** without ending the **Remote Session**.

### Pull
The act of fetching the resulting **Session Branch** (or a patch) from the **Remote Session** into the Developer's local environment.
